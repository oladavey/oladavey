## About Me

4th Year Mechatronics Engineering student focused on software development, data analysis, and AI system design. Interested in solving people-centered problems through machine learning and algorithmic thinking. Experienced in smart grid system design and collaborative development. Thrives in team settings, enjoys untangling complex systems, and oddly comfortable with chaos—possibly due to reading too much WWII history.
